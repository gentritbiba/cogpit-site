# Documentation Audit Report

**Commit ID:** 1588588
**Date:** 2026-02-19
**Auditor:** Documentation Auditor
**Change:** Added sub-agent activity view to MockConversationTimeline component

---

## Summary of Changes

The MockConversationTimeline component in `/Users/gentritbiba/cogpit-site/src/components/MockConversationTimeline.tsx` was updated to include a new sub-agent activity feature. This adds the ability to display nested agent activities within assistant turns.

### Technical Details

**Added interfaces:**
- `SubAgentMessage`: Interface for messages from sub-agents with optional thinking, text, and tool calls
- `SubAgentActivity`: Interface for sub-agent activity tracking with agentId, messageCount, and messages array

**Added component:**
- `SubAgentBlock`: New React component that renders a collapsible sub-agent activity panel with indigo styling
  - Displays agent ID and message count in badge
  - Shows thinking blocks with Brain icon
  - Shows text output with Cog icon
  - Shows tool calls with appropriate styling
  - Uses dashed border styling to differentiate from regular tool calls

**Updated UI elements:**
- Added `Users` and `Cog` icons from lucide-react
- Updated `Turn` interface to include optional `subAgentActivity` field
- Updated main render logic to conditionally render SubAgentBlock when subAgentActivity is present
- Added mock data showing a sub-agent (a232fb0) with 120 messages exploring theme persistence patterns

## Documentation Checked

### 1. `/Users/gentritbiba/cogpit-site/docs/` Directory
**Status:** DOES NOT EXIST
The docs directory does not exist in this project. No documentation files found at this path.

### 2. `/Users/gentritbiba/cogpit-site/README.md`
**Status:** REQUIRES CONTEXT CHECK
The README.md file exists and contains basic Astro project setup instructions. However, it is generic Astro documentation and does not document the MockConversationTimeline component or its features.

**Current Content:** Generic "Astro Starter Kit: Minimal" template covering:
- Project structure
- Commands (bun install, bun dev, bun build, etc.)
- Basic Astro concepts

**Finding:** The README does NOT document:
- The MockConversationTimeline component
- Component architecture or features
- Sub-agent activity view feature
- This is expected as the README focuses on build/setup, not component features

### 3. Component Usage in `/Users/gentritbiba/cogpit-site/src/pages/index.astro`
**Status:** DOCUMENTATION FOUND
The MockConversationTimeline component is used in the landing page with accompanying documentation:

**Relevant Section (lines 94-115):**
```
<!-- ═══ CONVERSATION TIMELINE DEMO ═══ -->
<section id="demo" class="border-t border-zinc-800/50">
  <div class="mx-auto max-w-4xl px-6 py-20">
    <div class="text-center mb-10">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight sm:text-3xl">Conversation Timeline</h2>
      <p class="mt-3 text-base text-zinc-400">
        See every turn, tool call, edit diff, and agent thought — all in one interactive view. Click to expand.
      </p>
    </div>
    ...
    <MockConversationTimeline client:load />
  </div>
</section>
```

**Finding:** The landing page description mentions "every turn, tool call, edit diff, and agent thought" but does NOT explicitly mention sub-agent activity views. This is now an outdated description given the new feature.

---

## Documentation Update Recommendations

### REQUIRED UPDATES:

1. **Update `/Users/gentritbiba/cogpit-site/src/pages/index.astro` (line 100)**

   Current text:
   ```
   See every turn, tool call, edit diff, and agent thought — all in one interactive view. Click to expand.
   ```

   Recommended replacement:
   ```
   See every turn, tool call, edit diff, agent thought, and sub-agent activity — all in one interactive view. Click to expand.
   ```

   **Rationale:** The new sub-agent activity view is now a core feature of the timeline component and should be reflected in the hero description.

### OPTIONAL IMPROVEMENTS:

2. **Consider creating dedicated documentation files**

   If component documentation becomes more complex, create:
   - `/Users/gentritbiba/cogpit-site/docs/COMPONENTS.md` - Component architecture guide
   - `/Users/gentritbiba/cogpit-site/docs/FEATURES.md` - Feature descriptions

   Current Status: NOT REQUIRED - The landing page serves as sufficient documentation for now.

3. **Feature Grid already mentions "Sub-Agent Tracking" (lines 172-180)**

   Existing feature card at line 172-180:
   ```
   <h3 class="text-sm font-semibold">Sub-Agent Tracking</h3>
   <p class="mt-1.5 text-xs text-zinc-400 leading-relaxed">See nested agent spawns and their work. Track teams, task assignments, and inter-agent messages in real-time.</p>
   ```

   **Status:** GOOD - This feature card is already present and describes the sub-agent tracking capability well. No update needed.

---

## Audit Conclusion

**Summary:**
- Documentation exists in inline comments and the landing page
- The feature is partially documented through the feature grid
- The main landing page description is OUTDATED and needs a minor update to mention sub-agent activity

**Required Actions:**
- Update the Conversation Timeline section description in `index.astro` to mention sub-agent activity

**Files Affected:**
- `/Users/gentritbiba/cogpit-site/src/pages/index.astro` (1 line change needed)

**No breaking changes detected.** The new feature is additive and backward compatible with existing component usage.
